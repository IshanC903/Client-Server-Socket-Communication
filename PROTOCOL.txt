This assignment required us to create a multi threaded server to deal with multiple file transfers at the same time. 
When the server its started it is listening on port 1427. It has a fixed thread pool of 10, meaning it can handle 10 connections 
at one time. When Client.java is executed, it sends a request for a file to the address and port of the server, once the server 
receives this request, it will look up to see if it has the file. When the server locates the file, it will send it to the requesting 
client and increment its request counter.
